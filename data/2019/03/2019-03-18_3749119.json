    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Due to the heavy rain that lasted for several days last week, the Public Works Bureau and related departments are asked to evaluate and identify possible instances of sinkholes or subsidence. The Public Works Bureau and the Water Resources Bureau should inspect and renew old culvert and sinkholes and make sure that maintenance work is complete before the flood season.2. Recently, there has been much misinformation circulated by the media about the government. Several policies with good intentions are not truthfully represented in media coverage, and there is still room for improvement regarding how our colleagues handle this issue. It is our public&rsquo;s right to file complaints to the government, and I would like to ask all departments to clarify and respond to people&rsquo;s questions as soon as possible. Also, the Department of Information should provide accurate and correct information to our citizens to avoid misunderstanding in our work. We hope that the government could gain more support from the people and our policies be fully understood.",
