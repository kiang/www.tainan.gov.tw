The annual Taiwan International Orchid Show is a grand event for Tainan, and a significant opportunity for the city to showcase its capability in agriculture, culture, and tourism industry. I would like to ask each department to evaluate all promotion channels and work with the Agriculture Bureau to promote the Orchid Show, thereby boosting local tourism and economy.2. Thanks to the hard work of the Police Department, the attempted murder case last week was solved within sixteen hours. In order to strengthen law and order and to ensure the safety of our residents, the Police Department, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Fire Bureau are asked to draw on successful practices at home and abroad and to draft plans to establish a community safety network.3. With the efforts made by preceding mayors and staff members of Tainan City Government and the support of the central government, Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City has made preliminary achievements. To advance the development of the Science City, relevant departments should continue to assist resident institutions and enterprises with administrative procedures. Furthermore, the Economic Development Bureau should work with the Department of Information to reinforce the promotion efforts at home and abroad to attract more investments.",
