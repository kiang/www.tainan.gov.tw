The Research Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) is now organizing meetings for the Benchmark Program, which will be hosted and supervised by our two Deputy Mayors. I would like to ask the Secretary-General to supervise every department to make sure that the program is carried out at all levels, including policy implementation and budget making. After the first round of meetings, I will try my best to participate in the following rolling meetings. We together form a team, and when promoting policies, we should act like one and demonstrate team spirit.2. I would like to assign Deputy Mayor Wang to host the liaison officer meetings, and to lead the Bureau of Civil Affairs and the RDEC to organize and follow up the service cases to maintain good relationships between the government and the city council.3. The growing number of visitors to Tainan has stimulated local businesses. But at the same time, it has also caused traffic congestion and sanitary challenges, and put stress on the environment. On the review meetings of the Yuejin Lantern Festival, Taiwan International Orchid Show, and festivals of temples, the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Agriculture Bureau, and the Bureau of Civil Affairs should work with the Bureau of Transportation and the Police Department to propose traffic improvement plans.",
