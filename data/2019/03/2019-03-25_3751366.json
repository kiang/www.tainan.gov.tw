Regarding citizens&rsquo; questions, all bureaus and departments should refer to the advertisement produced by the Finance and Local Tax Bureau so as to properly promote related information; if necessary, the Finance and Local Tax Bureau should add the information on the back of the envelopes while sending out tax statements in May, so that correct information can be known by the public.2. When announcing major policies, explanations that are clear and easy to understand should be included, and if necessary graphs and charts should also be included. Questions from the public and city councilors should be responded to in time as well. Should there be any problems, please seek assistance from supervisors.3. Many citizens pay close attention to the construction progress of Tainan Railway Station&rsquo;s new building and the underground railway tracks. Deputy Mayor Hsu, please supervise our Transportation Bureau and Public Works Bureau, so that they can properly communicate with the central government and explain the progress to our citizens in a timely manner.",
