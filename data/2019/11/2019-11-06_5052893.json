    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Preventing diseases is like fighting a war. Although we have seen a decline of cases of dengue fever, new confirmed cases of enterovirus appear this month. The Public Health Bureau should enhance disease prevention and control, and with the collective efforts from the Bureau of Education, Bureau of Civil Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Bureau, stop the spread of enterovirus.2. The tourism industry accounts for a considerably large portion of Tainan&rsquo;s overall production value. The Bureau of Transportation will announce the autumn and winter hot spring subsidy program in the near future. The Tourism and Travel Bureau should assist the service providers with the application to shorten the time needed for reimbursement, and to help them design attractive tourism packages.3. The recent subsidy program on child care facility has received plenty of positive feedback. The Labor Affairs Bureau, Bureau of Social Affairs, and Economic Development Bureau should continue with the discussion on strategy to improve child care in workplace. Large-scale providers should be supported by the government to set up quality day care facility, which could spare parents from moving around places and increase productivity for both employees and companies.",
