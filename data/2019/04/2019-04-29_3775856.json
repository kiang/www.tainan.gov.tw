As the Tainan City Council is now holding its regular session, we should review our work and evaluate our performance accordingly based on the councilors&rsquo; questions and inquiries. If there is truly room for improvements, we will definitely make efforts to do better. However, if any comments or arguments contradict the facts, then we should clarify immediately. We should also seek support from the Department of Information to improve the quality of communication and be responsible to our citizens.",
