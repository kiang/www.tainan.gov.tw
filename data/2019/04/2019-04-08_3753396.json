Today, we have the Bureau of Civil Affairs and the Bureau of Education presenting reports on 2019 Tomb Sweeping Day citizen-friendly work and on 2019 V WBSC U12 Baseball World Championship, both of which are important focus of work in the city government. As a livable city that is travel-friendly, the amount of people and tourists in Tainan during holidays is significantly higher than that on weekdays. Needless to say, it results in a heavier workload for the government, especially in the transportation and public safety sector. I would like to ask all departments to do their best to fulfill their duties and collaborate with other colleagues to demonstrate efficiency to our citizens. Thank you in advance for your hard work.",
