I would like to thank the departments involved in this task for their efforts. Please keep up the good work. With Chinese New Year approaching, the Bureau of Economic Development and Agriculture Bureau are asked to pay special attention to commodity prices to prevent people from intentionally hiking up prices.2. During the Chinese New Year holiday, the Department of Transportation and the Police Department are responsible for implementing traffic easing plans at major scenic areas and sections prone to traffic jams.3. I would like to ask all departments for their cooperation in promoting the 2019 Happy New Year event and encouraging the public to visit Tainan during the Chinese New Year holiday. Departments responsible for organizing related events are reminded to provide quality communication channels and services and to place an equal emphasis on tourists&rsquo; needs and citizens&rsquo; quality of life.4. Finally, I would like to thank all staff members of the Tainan City Government for their dedication over the past year. I wish all staff members and citizens a happy Chinese New Year, excellent health, and the greatest success.",
