    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. The Bureau of Transportation has started a series of public hearings on the Tainan MRT Green Line since yesterday (September 2). I appreciate the efforts from all colleagues of the Bureau. During the public hearings, we should do our best to gather citizens&rsquo; opinion. The attendance for yesterday was poor. The Bureau should strengthen the promotion for the following sessions.2. As the dengue fever season is still ongoing, all citizens should not let down their guard yet. The Public Health Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Bureau of Civil Affairs, and other concerned departments should continue with the efforts of educating the public and clearing mosquito breeding grounds. Since schools have already started for the new semester, the Bureau of Education should disseminate relevant information and ask schools to reinforce disease prevention measures.3. It is reported today (September 3) that pig carcass was found along the coast of Tainan. The Agriculture Bureau should strictly follow up the result of testing and the handling of the incident.",
