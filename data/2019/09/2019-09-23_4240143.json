To achieve gender equality in Tainan City, it is important to do whatever we could, along with schools of all levels, to prevent incidents of discrimination in schools and in the workplace. The goal of &ldquo;zero incident&rdquo; still hasn&rsquo;t been reached, and preventive measures are crucial. Competent authorities should exert zero tolerance towards incidents of bully and discrimination based on gender, carry out investigation when cases are reported, and impose heavy punishment if allegations are confirmed. Fighting against discrimination and promoting gender equality has been a commonly concerned issue. The responsibility does not lie on any individual bureau only. I hope we could all work together.2. Tech giants such as TSMC and Google are ramping up investment in Tainan. Many citizens are excited about such development, but to attract more international investment, Tainan&rsquo;s capability to provide clean energy and reclaimed water has to improve. The Economic Development Bureau and other concerned departments should continue to look for possible sites to develop renewable energy, and to formulate more cross-bureau green energy plans to further attract investors to Tainan.",
