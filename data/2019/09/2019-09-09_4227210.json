The public hearings so far have all been held during regular working hours. The Bureau should evaluate the possibility and need to adjust the time of future sessions so that more citizens could get to know the government&rsquo;s planning by participating in hearings held during night or weekends.(3) Once the National Spatial Plan is finalized, making changes will be difficult in the future. If lands are needed in relevant industry development plans, responsible bureaus should notify the Bureau of Urban Development immediately so that change of land use could be made in the future, and plans could be carried out smoothly.",
