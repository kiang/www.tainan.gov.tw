Thanks to our colleagues&rsquo; dedication and quick reactions, responses have been made to the flooding areas reported during midnight. The government&rsquo;s pumps are maintained at high availability. The grade 2 disaster response center was activated on 5:20 AM yesterday, and all government staff managed to confront and respond to the disaster straightaway. It is expected that proactive measures be taken in the future in face of extreme weather.2. District Offices should assist the affected residents with the application for flooding subsidy as soon as possible. In terms of determining the applicants&rsquo; eligibility, a unified list of requirements should be in place and used by all District Offices. The chaos after the 823 Flood last year must not appear again, and unnecessary recurring inspections are not acceptable.3. It is inevitable that disasters cause damages and losses to agriculture and fishery, including crops and infrastructure. The Agriculture Bureau should introduce the correct method of collecting proof and relevant procedures to the farmers. Now is a good time to persuade farmers to participate in the existing agriculture insurance program, which offers better protection to their crops and livestock.Announcements1. The Finance and Local Tax Bureau&rsquo;s report on the promotion of mobile payment. (refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filingMayor&rsquo;s Remarks:(1) Mobile payment, both remote and proximity payment, brings convenience to citizens&rsquo; daily life. Relevant departments and bureaus should carefully store and use the data collected from transaction, given the fact that there have been cases of personal information leakage through online payment system. Information security should be of priority to ensure safety of mobile payment.2. The Tourism and Travel Bureau&rsquo;s report on strategy in response to the Chinese ban on individual travelers. (refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filingMayor&rsquo;s Remarks:(1) Tainan is a city of tourism and delicious food. The promotion of tourism is a responsibility that should be cast on the shoulders of all bureaus, not just the Tourism and Travel Bureau. I expect to see brilliant ideas be proposed on cross-department platform. Limited tourism resources should be integrated to maximize their effectiveness.(2) The Bureau won the budget from the Ministry of Transportation and Communication for Houbi and Yanshui under the Taiwan Small Town program. However, the biggest obstacle that hinders tourists from visiting these towns is still transportation. The Tourism and Travel Bureau and the Bureau of Transportation should put together solutions that improve the accessibility. Resources should be invested and utilized effectively to yield high-value result.",
