    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. The 2019 V WBSC U12 Baseball World Championship successfully closed yesterday. However, it is not the end to our work. We need to humbly accept all feedbacks and make improvements accordingly. In terms of infrastructure, there were flaws found in the facilities of the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Stadiums and Training Centers. There were also problems in the schedule arrangement and the maintenance of order during games. We need to strengthen our relationship with the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association and the World Baseball Softball Confederation. Also, a lot of work need to be done to improve the Tainan City Junior Baseball Team. We hope that when the U12 Baseball World Championship take place in Tainan again two years from now, the venue, infrastructure, and facilities could all be perfected, the arrangement of the schedule will be improved, the Taiwan&rsquo;s team will win the championship again, and more athletes from Tainan will participate in the games. Overtime pay or bonus should be given to staff members who have worked hard for the event according to relevant regulations.",
