I am grateful for the help and support from all concerned bureaus and departments: the Police Department for maintaining order and safety; the Public Works Bureau for hurrying to finish the construction in bad weather condition; the Bureau of Education for arranging the games and receiving the athletes. As the Championship is still ongoing, relevant bureaus should continue to spare no effort to assist athletes, maintain smooth flow of traffic and safety, and make a good impression on the audience and participants. According to the weather forecast of the Central Weather Bureau, there will be heavy rain starting from Thursday, which may affect the games. The Bureau of Education should take precautions accordingly.2. Heavy rain is expected to arrive on Thursday. The Water Resources Bureau, the Fire Bureau, and the Office of Disaster Management should closely monitor the weather and be fully prepared. Before the rain comes, the Public Health Bureau, the Environmental Protection Bureau and other concerned departments should continue to wipe out mosquito breeding grounds to prevent dengue fever, especially in areas with higher ovitrap index.",
