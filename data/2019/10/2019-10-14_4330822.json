In addition to presenting Tainan&rsquo;s natural bounty and tourism resources, it is important to also include introduction to public transport in promotional materials. Emergency plans regarding traffic routes, public toilets, and parking spaces should be formed in advance to show visitors how we take every small detail seriously. The organizing bureaus should communicate horizontally across departments prior to the events and treat every visitor with the utmost respect and hospitality.2. The recent factory fire in Taichung and the sudden collapse of the Nanfang&#39;ao Bridge in Yilan serve as great reminders. Tainan City Government should take measures to prevent factory fire and conduct tests of bridges to safeguard citizens&rsquo; safety. The Economic Development Bureau should announce the handling process of illegal factories located on agricultural land and develop complementary measures. Inquiry channel should be set up to let citizens understand clearly the government&rsquo;s policy regarding illegal factories. The Public Works Bureau should complete bridge inspection following the existing SOP, especially focusing on bridges by the sea, which are prone to corrosion.",
