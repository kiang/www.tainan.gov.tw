When signs of historical relics are discovered, relevant authority should be notified and review meeting of cultural heritage should be held. Bureaus and departments should respect the conclusion of the meeting, and strike a balance between public construction and the protection of cultural heritage.2. With the assistance of the Department of Information, the bureaus are able to respond to city councilors&rsquo; questions during the interpellation session in a timely manner. Please keep up the good work, and remember to follow up on those questions and propose long-term improvement plan. In addition, bureaus should have a spokesperson mechanism, to review and improve the content and speed of response. If support is needed, please contact the Department of Information. The release of information and public relations are matters concerning the whole city government, not just the Department of Information. All bureaus and departments are expected to collaborate closely with the Department.",
