    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. The request for advance payment proposed by the city government is still under review in the city council and has not been passed. These subsidies approved by the central government are related to the wellbeing of the disadvantaged, prevention of swine fever, and flood-preventing constructions. All departments and bureaus are expected to negociate with the council with the greatest sincerity to win their support. Such communicating process should be transparent and made public to protect the rights of our citizens.",
