The result of it is a direct indicator showing the performance of the government&rsquo;s emergency response mechanism, and it challenges us to ensure residents&rsquo; safety of life and property. I hope all my colleagues will be on the alert and be fully prepared. Typhoons bring strong winds and intense rains. The typhoon we are expecting this time is forecast to bring a massive amount of rain. Earlier this morning (July 17), an Emergency Operation Center was established. The Fire Bureau, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Water Resources Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Agriculture Bureau, and other concerned departments should take necessary precautions to lower the impact. In addition, prevention of dengue fever should continue. I urge our citizens to stay vigilant, take preventive measures against typhoon, and remember to clear mosquito breeding grounds by &ldquo;inspecting the environment regularly, and cleaning containers holding standing water.&rdquo; The Public Health Bureau and the Environmental Protection Bureau should continue with the promotion on dengue prevention.\nAnnouncements1.
