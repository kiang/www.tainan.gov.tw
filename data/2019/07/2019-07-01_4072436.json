    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. The mango season is just around the corner. This year, both the quantity and quality are satisfactory. The Agriculture Bureau should ensure the grading mechanism is effectively implemented so that price is not affected by uneven quality. All bureaus and departments should assist with promotion. In addition, unscrupulous vendors should be punished, and relevant information be released to avoid misunderstanding. It is the mandate of county and city governments to decide when to initiate the acquisition and processing procedure. Please take into account the farmers&rsquo; best interest when discussing about the timing. Remember to proceed with marketing and mango processing in a professional manner, and issue announcement and explanation when needed. 2. Extra caution should be made to prevent accidents during summer vacation. The Police Department, Fire Bureau, Bureau of Education, and Public Health Bureau should take precautions against accidents and injuries common among young people. Inspections should be conducted with the joint efforts from all bureaus to protect every young and precious life.",
