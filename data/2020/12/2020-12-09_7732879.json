If the City Council cannot finish reviewing all budgets tomorrow, additional budget review meetings are planned to be held from December 21 to 25. Bureaus and departments that have pending budget reviewers should enhance communication with council members to streamline the budget approval process.2. It has been reported that quarantine hotels in Tainan have been taking in more migrant workers than the allowed quota. The Tourism and Travel Bureau, Public Health Bureau, and the Labor Affairs Bureau should ensure proper communication across bureaus and conduct personnel control and inspections. To prevent loopholes in pandemic prevention, regulations should be adhered to and hotels violating such rules should face punishment.",
