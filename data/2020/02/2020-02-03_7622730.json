Since Tainan&rsquo;s upgrading to a special municipality, we have been progressively reducing government debt every year, with the goal of not leaving debt to our children&rsquo;s generation. I thank all colleagues of the Finance and Local Tax Bureau for your hard work.(3) In terms of tax modernization, the Bureau also did a great job. Mobile payment has been promoted, and various service and work, including tax payment, are connected and improved.

We have to cut down on expenditure, make better use of resources, and find new sources of income. We hope that by adjusting house tax, living justice and tax equality can be achieved. It is our common goal to use legislation and taxation to better housing market, reflect the need for justice of residents, release more idle housing, and ensure affordable prices for people in need. Let&rsquo;s all work together in promoting bills and increase relevant budget.",
