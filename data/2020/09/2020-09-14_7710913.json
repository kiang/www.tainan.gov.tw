Concerned bureaus should carefully plan the arrangement of programs, stands, and traffic. Attention should be put especially on the traffic flow of VIPs. We should do our best to ensure that our citizens have a joyful Double Tenth long holiday.(2) Regarding the quantity of stands, 480 is the currently planned number, but it may be increased in the future. 5% of the stands will be &ldquo;charity stands&rdquo;, meaning that no rental fee, but only cleaning fee will be charged. The Police Department should conduct extra patrol in the parking lot, areas with high density of people, and around the stands to prevent incidents of theft, conflicts, and gang fights.(3) The Economic Development Bureau may request vendors to prepare their own garbage cans. This will reduce littering, lower the workload of cleaners, and help maintain a clean environment.",
