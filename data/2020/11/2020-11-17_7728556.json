    "content": "Major&rsquo;s Remarks:A preliminary inventory taken for the &ldquo;Lighting Up Rural Tainan&rdquo; initiative revealed the need to install over 3000 streetlights and surveillance equipment worth over NTD $40 million. Horizontal communication channels must be established between district offices, police departments, and the 1999 Citizen Hotline to streamline report-to-repair operations, and concerned departments must identify outdated or depreciated surveillance cameras as soon as possible to cauterize public complaints and uphold the city government&#39;s reputation. I ask the Secretary-General to overlook the consolidation and inventory-taking processes in the various departments. The Second Reserve Fund shall cover relevant expenses, and all objectives should be met by the end of the year.\nAnnouncements1. The Bureau of Urban Development&rsquo;s presentation of the 2020 Annual Report (refer to written sources for details)2. The Land Administration Bureau&rsquo;s presentation of the 2020 Annual Report (refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filing(1) I thank the Bureau of Urban Development and Land Administration Bureau for their progress reports. The efforts of our colleagues are evidenced in the reports. We have received recognition by the Central Government for several operations carried out by the Bureau of Urban Development. These achievements also ring real for the Land Administration Bureau. I again thank our colleagues for their hard work.(2) Regarding land auction, please fortify our outward messaging so that the public understands that land development is costly and auctioning cost-equivalent land is a means to raise capital. Since it is an auction, sales prices cannot be set. Instead, we must adhere to market mechanisms. We currently face a dilemma in the development of public infrastructure. Halting construction causes the devaluation of land and incites public concerns regarding the absence of local development, whereas commencing construction increases land value, which could spark concerns regarding high land\/housing prices and affordability issues.(3) Although land and housing prices have risen in Tainan City, they remain the lowest of the six major municipalities. We must remain vigilant and accelerate our public housing initiatives to provide social housing opportunities to newcomers to the workforce and underprivileged groups. I have been actively planning public housing initiatives since taking office. I call on the Bureau of Urban Development and Land Administration Bureau to work together and form a cohesive and straightforward narrative for the public, thereby improving public perception.",
