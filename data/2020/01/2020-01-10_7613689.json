    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Thanks to all of our colleagues&rsquo; efforts and devotion, Tainan City ranked among the best in quite a few national evaluations. I expect us to carry on with the good work, maintain the great performance, and continue to increase residents&rsquo; welfare and living quality.2. Although there are several New Year markets in the city, the Xinhua New Year Market has the best reputation and the longest history. It has become a grand event of the year, and hope that through the organization of various activities, the market will draw both people and money to the small town. This year, the Chinese New Year Holiday falls on earlier dates, leaving shorter periods of time for events and activities. The Economic Development Bureau should increase efforts and achieve higher number of visitors and sales compared to previous years. Other New Year markets are also expected to set new records in general.",
