    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Tainan has entered the peak season for tourism. To boost the economy and stimulate consumption, a monthly raffle was launched since the &ldquo;Triple Stimulus Vouchers&rdquo; became effective on July 15. For every purchase of 200 NTD or more, one set of serial number will be provided for the raffle, and each person can earn up to 100 sets of number. It is expected that through the stimulus program from both central and local governments, consumption could significantly increase. 2. Regarding city promotion events in the second half of the year, such as Chinese Valentine&rsquo;s Day series activities (Tainan Chihsi Festival) and the promotion of pomelo, the Cultural Affairs Bureau and the Agriculture Bureau should ensure a good cross-department coordination to guarantee the success of the events. In addition, attention should also be put on traffic control, maintenance of environment, and parking spaces. The Environmental Protection Bureau, Bureau of Transportation, the Police Department and other concerned bureaus should have adequate planning in advance to prevent complaints from arising.",
