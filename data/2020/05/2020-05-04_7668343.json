According to the Central Epidemic Command Center, no domestic cases have been reported for 15 days in a row. However, with the virus still affecting numerous countries around the world, we should continue to take rigorous and careful actions.2. With the coming of the Labor Day weekend, citizens might have concerns over restrictions to certain public places or the details of the applied preventive measures. Concerned bureaus should increase efforts in the promotion of relevant guidelines so that people have certain rules to follow. This will prevent public panic and help citizens stay on high alert. Guidelines may include: wear face masks or keep a one-meter social distance outdoor; avoid eating with strangers and choose takeout if possible in night markets or traditional markets; when dine in, distance between tables should be maintained. Currently, crowd control has been implemented in crowded public places. I hope that through promoting the above-mentioned guidelines, people can still enjoy normal life. In the meanwhile, I ask all colleagues to stay diligent and do your best in disease-prevention work.",
