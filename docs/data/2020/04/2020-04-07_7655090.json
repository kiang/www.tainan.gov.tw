I appreciate the report form the Bureau of Urban Development on the rolling execution plan of social housing and that from the Environmental Protection Bureau regarding measures to promote clean environment. The Bureau of Urban Development has invested a large amount of manpower and resources to acquire and construct social housing, which will be provided as rental housing for people in need. I am especially grateful for their efforts.2. Last week, we held simulation exercise on registering incoming citizens&rsquo; identity and sending colleagues to work at different offices. We practiced what staff members should do if there are confirmed cases inside the city hall. The goal is to maintain regular governmental services but minimize chance of infection at the same time. We saw fruitful results from the drills, and cooperation from all colleagues are sincerely appreciated.3. Disease prevention work during Tomb Sweeping Holiday is crucial. Concerned bureaus should control entry into the columbarium pagodas and promote relevant measures to stop creating possible routes of infection. In addition, regarding tourists visiting Tainan during the long holiday, social distancing should be promoted. The Secretariat should draft plans on how social distance can be maintained during future municipal administrative meetings.",
