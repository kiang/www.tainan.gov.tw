(refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filing2. The Fire Bureau&rsquo;s report on the promotion of smart emergency medical service. (refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filingMayor&rsquo;s Remarks:(1) While the average success rate of first aid last year in Taiwan was 22.6%, the figure for Tainan City was as high as 27.5%, which higher 5% than the average success rate in Taiwan. Looking forward, we will continue our efforts in saving lives. This year, the 61 ambulances in the city have all been installed with the 12-lead ECG, which is expected to further save time and increase efficiency for emergency medical service. I hope that with this new smart system, and through the efforts from our colleagues and collaboration between responsible hospitals, the success rate can further be increased, and thus citizens&rsquo; health and lives be better protected.(2) During the past few months, our colleagues&rsquo; workload has increased due to various virus prevention measures. Numerous frontline workers have also devoted their time to quarantine service, entrance control, and other prevention work. In addition, as the weather is getting warmer, we already saw imported dengue fever cases; the first local case appeared last year around late June. I hope that with collective efforts, we could better control dengue fever this year.",
