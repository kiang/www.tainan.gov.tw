    "content": "Major&rsquo;s Remarks:A preliminary inventory taken for the &ldquo;Lighting Up Rural Tainan&rdquo; initiative revealed the need to install over 3000 streetlights and surveillance equipment worth over NTD $40 million. Horizontal communication channels must be established between district offices, police departments, and the 1999 Citizen Hotline to streamline report-to-repair operations, and concerned departments must identify outdated or depreciated surveillance cameras as soon as possible to cauterize public complaints and uphold the city government&#39;s reputation. I ask the Secretary-General to overlook the consolidation and inventory-taking processes in the various departments. The Second Reserve Fund shall cover relevant expenses, and all objectives should be met by the end of the year.",
