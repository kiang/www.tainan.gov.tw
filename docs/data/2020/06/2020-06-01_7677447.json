Anti-corruption has always been a major focus in the city government. In recent years, Tainan has carried out several large-scale public construction projects, which easily draw attention from the public. The &ldquo;anti-corruption platform&rdquo; established by the city government can prevent our colleagues from unnecessary interference and lobbying, which will in a way make citizens feel like the government is clean and efficient.(2) To manage cases of corruption and to minimize unnecessary legal process in the future, it is important to prevent such incidents from happening in the first place. Anti-corruption working culture should be established, and basic legal knowledge should be taught to all government staff.",
