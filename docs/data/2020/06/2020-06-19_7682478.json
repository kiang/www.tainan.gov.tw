(refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filing(1) Supervising unregistered factories is a policy goal set by the central government according to the law. The Economic Development Bureau should act in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and take proactive measures to help factories categorized as low-pollution become legal entity and be incorporated into the government management. It is inevitable that some unscrupulous persons will try to seek improper interests during the process of legalization and guidance of these factories. In face of lobby or pressure from certain groups of people, the Bureau should always follow the law and ensure justice.(2) Factories established before 2016 May 19 have the opportunities to be legalized or registered as certain factories. The Bureau should provide guidance and assistance to factories that meet the legal requirements, and cease the operation of illegal ones. District Offices and chiefs of Village should monitor the factories built after 2016 May 20 closely. Any violation should be reported and factories should be demolished instantly once proved illegal. The Public Works Bureau should work accordingly to ensure the execution of government&rsquo;s policy and to reduce troubles for law enforcement agencies and bodies of elected representatives.2.
