It was not about fighting for the first place, but more about achieving concrete effects at the beginning of the pandemic.

I appreciate the report and all the hard work from the Public Health Bureau.2. The Cultural Affairs Bureau&rsquo;s report on 2020 Tainan Museum Festival. (refer to written sources for details)Decision: Approved for reference filingMayor&rsquo;s Remarks:(1) Tainan is home to 57 museums and community cultural museums. The Tainan Museum Festival held every year has drawn numerous tourists from home and abroad. Although this year, the festival may be affected by the pandemic, it is a great timing for cultural facilities to conduct digital transformation. The Cultural Affairs Bureau should take notice of any relevant subsidy program in either the central government&rsquo;s stimulus package or other plans so that the quality of museums can be improved and their overall environment be further optimized.(2) The Tainan Museum Festival also demonstrates the city&rsquo;s confidence in the battle against COVID-19 and the ambition to stimulate the tourism industry.
