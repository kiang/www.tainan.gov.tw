    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. As the outbreak of the novel coronavirus continues and schools start next week, the Bureau of Education should strengthen promotion and implementation of the following directions: First, schools should be fully aware of the storage location of disease prevention supplies (such as alcohol). Second, to avoid further spread of the disease, when conducting prevention work, physical contact between personnel should be limited. Third, if schools are forced to close, the Bureau should initiate online courses so that students may continue with their learning progress. Fourth, the Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Affairs should start establishing measures to assist students who are now trapped in China. It is important that they are not subject to stigmatization or isolation when they returned to Taiwan, which may have a negative impact on their physical and mental health and their academic performance. 2. The Bureau of Education should follow the standards for the suspension of classes and guidelines when confirmed case of COVID-19 is discovered in schools announced by the central government. In addition, bailout plan will be passed shortly. Once it&rsquo;s passed, the Department of Legal Affairs should inform all bureaus, and responsive plans should be made accordingly. If proposed measures are for disease prevention, but do not comply with the subsidy requirements, then they could be handled by city government. The goal is to seize the opportunity to upgrade equipment and increase training in relevant industry so that higher-quality services could be provided to consumers in the future.",
