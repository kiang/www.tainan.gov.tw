Dengue fever has caused great impact on Tainan City in the past. Up till now, the city has reported four imported cases, which means that indigenous cases are not far away. All district offices, the Environmental Protection Bureau, Public Health Bureau, and other concerned departments should put more attention on eliminating mosquito breeding grounds to eradicate the disease.2. City and county governments around Taiwan are drawing up contingency plans to send personnel to other offices to work to combat the spread of COVID-19. The goal is to keep the government running and all service in operation amid the outbreak. Tainan City Government should start creating our own plan, taking into consideration the nature of different units when allocating their new location. The Deputy Mayors should lead and monitor the bureaus they are responsible for in this matter.",
