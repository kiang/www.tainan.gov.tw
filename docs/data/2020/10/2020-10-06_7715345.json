I would like to reiterate that public safety, smooth traffic, and clean environment should be maintained by concerned bureaus so that our citizens and tourists could really enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday and the National Day holiday.2. During the trial run for the Double Tenth Day fireworks display, congestion was reported due to a traffic accident. Citizens and friends from the media hence doubted that the city government has not been fully prepared for the holiday. In the future, the Police Department should handle any traffic accidents as soon as possible to avoid such misunderstanding.3. The Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) will include the establishment of public sports centers, planning of New Year activities, installment of solar power facilities, and improvement of traffic as part of the assessment items in District Chief&rsquo;s performance review.4. Regarding the objective and subjective indicators listed in the CommonWealth Magazine and Global Views Monthly city survey, the RDEC should organize a list of unfairly judged items so that the government can present complaints to the magazines. In addition, reasons should also be listed regarding items that Tainan City received low scores for. The Secretary General should hold meetings with concerned bureaus to come up with strategies for improvement.Announcements1.
