    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. The National Day fireworks display was held in Tainan on October 10. The event concluded successfully. In response to positive feedback from the public, please keep up the good work. Concerned bureaus are asked to review criticisms and make improvements accordingly.2. From September 1 to September 30, the municipal government enhanced crackdowns on traffic violations. Although casualties from motor vehicle accidents in Tainan have gradually decreased over the years, there remains great room for improvement. In the face of severe traffic violations, I would like to ask the Police Department to strengthen its promotion and enforcement of transportation-related laws. Please also enhance the public&#39;s awareness of minor offenses.3. As large-scale businesses, both domestic and foreign, continue to invest in Tainan, there has been a rise in housing demands for both real estate investors and homeowners. I would like to ask the Bureau of Urban Development to collaborate with the Finance and Local Tax Bureau and Bureau of Land Administration to stipulate strategies for stabilizing housing prices with housing justice in mind, thereby safeguarding the housing rights of the youth and underprivileged groups.",
