The Bureau of Education should continue to promote the importance of environment maintenance and preventive measures on campus. Tainan has put into a huge amount of efforts in maintaining residents&rsquo; living environment, and the city ranked first among six special municipalities in terms of performance of public health policies. We also took the first place regarding COVID-19 prevention; the Bureau of Education should carry on with the good work. In addition, to offer AC in every classroom, the Bureau should continue with the review of electric power system in the 279 schools in the city. To create better learning environment for students, the possibility of installing solar panels and planting more trees should be evaluated by all bureaus. Green buildings on campus should be increased.2. Regarding US beef and pork, it should be pointed out that domestic meat has better quality and comes with a lower price. The Agriculture Bureau and the Economic Development Bureau should develop promotional strategy for domestic meat product. In addition to the existing certification mark, wholesale stores and Farmers&#39; Associations should be encouraged to set up designated area to attract catering service providers of large companies and industrial areas to purchase local meat products. High-quality beef and pork produced in Tainan should be promoted to more consumers.",
