Although Typhoon Mekkhala did not make landfall in Taiwan, I would still like to thank all the efforts and preparation made by the Water Resources Bureau, the Fire Department, the Police Department, and all District Offices. Currently, there have not been any report of major disasters. However, caution should be exercised. If water accumulation on roads or sewer blockage is observed, concerned bureaus should take actions as soon as possible.2. As a rising number of imported COVID-19 cases have been reported recently, the Central Epidemic Command Center announced stricter preventive measures. Starting from August 17, mandatory face mask requirements will be applied to all indoor activities. For large-scale outdoor activities, pandemic control measures should be implemented by responsible bureaus as well. The &ldquo;new prevention lifestyle&rdquo; principles should be promoted through all possible channels. In addition, the recent hot and humid weather is favorable for dengue fever transmission. Although no domestic cases have been reported in Tainan, northern Taiwan has already seen cases. With frequent contact between the north and the south, concerned bureaus should stay alert. All in all, preventive measures such as wearing facial masks, frequent hand washing, and social distancing should be promoted. At the same time, residents should be encouraged to wipe out mosquito breeding grounds and keep both indoor and outdoor environment clean.",
