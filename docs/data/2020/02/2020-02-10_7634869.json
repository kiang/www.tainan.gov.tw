This is the first Municipal Administrative Meeting since the Spring Festival, during which we put our focus on the number of tourists and quality of the tourism and transportation services. After the New Year, in addition to continuing promoting large-scale events held by the government and civil societies, facing the spread of the novel coronavirus, we took the lead to set up the Tainan City Government Coronavirus Task Force. Such task force is responsible for not only the prevention of the disease, but all responsive measures, following the instruction from the Central Epidemic Command Center. The outbreak has tremendous effects on economy and industry, so concerned bureaus should have responsive plans ready in advance to minimize the impact. We should all work together to serve our people, and ensure their quality of life.2. Although policies established prior to the New Year, including the promotion of green energy, attracting investment, renovating incinerators, revitalizing landfills, and traffic construction, should be continuously carried out, in the meantime, disease control and prevention is the tope priority.3. The central government is going to implement more measures to prevent the disease or to stimulate economy. Concerned bureaus should start discussing relevant actions and submit plans to the Coronavirus Task Force in order to request funds from the state.",
