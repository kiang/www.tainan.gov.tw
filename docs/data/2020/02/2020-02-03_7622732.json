Director generals of all bureaus and emergency contact persons of important tasks should keep their cellphones on during the Spring Festival to avoid any misconduct or mistakes in news release caused by lack of communication.2. Concerned bureaus should get the message out and make sure residents know the garbage truck schedule and the opening time of venues. I would like to extend my gratitude to all police officers, fire fighters, and sanitation workers who sacrifice their time with their families to stick to their posts. Hope that with the efforts from all of us, our citizens could have a safe and joyful Spring Festival.",
