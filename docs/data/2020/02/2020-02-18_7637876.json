As the coronavirus outbreak continues, the Tainan City Government Coronavirus Task Force will work closely with the central government in disease prevention work. Government relief and new regulations are expected to be established shortly. In the meantime, concerned bureaus should submit plans regarding the impact on local industries to the task force for further discussion. I would like to reiterate that bureaus and departments should be fully prepared in advance in response to the disease&rsquo;s impact on local industries, including evaluating the scope of loss and setting up plans as soon as possible.2. Tainan City has set its goal towards green energy. Projects such as autonomous bus, autonomous boat for garbage collection, and AI city patrol and inspection are all of great importance. Relative bureaus should continue to come up with application projects that are in line with this direction.3. Taiwan International Orchid Show 2020 will take place in Houbi from March 7. I hope that all bureaus could assist with the promotion of the Orchid Show, setting new records by combining Tainan&rsquo;s cultural and historical assets and distinctive local features.4. This year&rsquo;s Longci Light Festival, Yanshui fireworks, and Tucheng&rsquo;s whipping the spring ox activity successfully attracted tens of thousands of visitors. Thanks for the efforts from the Public Health Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Bureau of Transportation, Police Department and Fire Bureau, traffic stayed smooth and the environment was well-maintained. We will continue to host the Longci Light Festival at the end of this year. Our goal is to bring attractions located in remote area closer by holding activities, and to make Tainan known to the whole country and the international community by strengthening the city&rsquo;s status as the capital of Taiwan&rsquo;s art and culture.",
