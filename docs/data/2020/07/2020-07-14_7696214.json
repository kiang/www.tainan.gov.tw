The proposal submitted by the Bureau of Transportation on autonomous vehicles did not pass the second and third readings in the city council today (July 7). The Bureau should continue to communicate with city councilors so that the proposal may be approved during the next session and the plan of building Tainan into a smart city may be proceeded as expected.2. The &ldquo;Triple Stimulus Vouchers&rdquo; program will officially begin on July 15. Concerned bureaus should take this opportunity and create a win-win situation by boosting the industries that are most affected during the pandemic, and promoting industries that enjoy strong advantages. 3. As summer vacation is about to start, more focus should be put on teenagers. Instead of repeating previous practices, we should learn from past experience and do better. Resources from different bureaus should be integrated to further upgrade the planned activities, such as the 16-year-old coming-of-age ceremony and the Anping Orca Go Summer Carnival. In addition, charity or sports events should include teenagers as well. We need to make sure the adolescents enjoy a safe and fruitful summer vacation. Announcements1.
