Since last week, nearly 30,000 receipts have been registered in association with the &ldquo;Triple Stimulus Vouchers.&rdquo; To date, the consumption amount associated with the raffle registration has exceeded NTD $48 million in consumption. Therefore, concerned bureaus should enhance the promotion of relevant information.2. Because of Taiwan&rsquo;s success in combating Covid-19 through border control, the number of imported Dengue fever cases has also drastically decreased this year. To date, zero domestic cases have been reported. Nevertheless, we should not let our guard down, because there have been confirmed cases of other diseases, such as Japanese Encephalitis. The Public Health Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, and other concerned bureaus should continue its work on strengthen sanitation, public health measures ,and preventing mosquito vectors from breeding. I would also like to ask the Water Resources Bureau to continue its work on urgent water treatment and disseminate the importance of soil and water conservation.",
