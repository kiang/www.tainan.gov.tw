    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Given the fact that by the end of May this year, the accumulated number of imported dengue fever cases is already equivalent to the total case number last year, we cannot let our guard down in the prevention of the disease. &ldquo;It is better to overestimate the enemy and exert great caution in defense&rdquo; was stated in Sun Tzu&lsquo;s The Art of War. It is crucial to be fully prepared in advance. Once domestic case appears, Tainan&rsquo;s tourism, public health, and our citizens&rsquo; health will be seriously impacted. People might even start to question the capability of the city government, recalling the large-scale outbreak of dengue fever in the past. The Police Department, Environmental Protection Bureau, Bureau of Civil Affairs and other concerned departments should step up, work together, and strengthen the preventive measures in areas with higher ovitrap index and vector index.",
