    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. The torrential rain yesterday has caused severe flooding. Thanks to our colleagues&rsquo; dedication and quick reactions, responses have been made to the flooding areas reported during midnight. The government&rsquo;s pumps are maintained at high availability. The grade 2 disaster response center was activated on 5:20 AM yesterday, and all government staff managed to confront and respond to the disaster straightaway. It is expected that proactive measures be taken in the future in face of extreme weather.2. District Offices should assist the affected residents with the application for flooding subsidy as soon as possible. In terms of determining the applicants&rsquo; eligibility, a unified list of requirements should be in place and used by all District Offices. The chaos after the 823 Flood last year must not appear again, and unnecessary recurring inspections are not acceptable.3. It is inevitable that disasters cause damages and losses to agriculture and fishery, including crops and infrastructure. The Agriculture Bureau should introduce the correct method of collecting proof and relevant procedures to the farmers. Now is a good time to persuade farmers to participate in the existing agriculture insurance program, which offers better protection to their crops and livestock.",
