The Water Resources Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and other concerned departments should finish the repair of roads and carry out other actions in response to the disaster as soon as possible to demonstrate the administrative efficiency of the city government. Last night, after pruning street trees in the West Central District, our contractor did not move away the branches right away and complaints were received. To maintain the image of the government, the contractor should be held responsible for obstructing traffic and influencing community&rsquo;s safety.2. A new tourist hotel opened yesterday in Tainan, which is by far the largest hotel covering the most area of base with the highest number of rooms throughout the city. We are happy to see such development, which shows that the tourism providers have confidence in Tainan. The government should continue promoting the city&rsquo;s tourism. The Tourism and Travel Bureau, Agriculture Bureau, Cultural Affairs Bureau, Bureau of Education, and other concerned departments should collaborate with each other and integrate tourism resources horizontally to show our strong tourism momentum to all Taiwanese people and to generate marketing buzz.",
