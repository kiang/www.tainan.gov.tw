    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Tainan Shan Shang Garden And Old Waterworks Museum is going to be a new tourism highlight of the city, following the example of Tainan City Zuijhen Fossil Park. The two museums are located in neighboring areas, and can be combined into a tourist attraction zone. When former Premier William Lai served as mayor of Tainan, Taiwan Water Corporation handed over Shan Shang water purification plant, which was already decommissioned years ago, to Tainan City Government. It is now turned into a watercourse museum with tourism and education value after maintenance and renovation. The museum is scheduled to open on the Double Tenth Day, and is expected to draw a large wave of visitors. The Cultural Affairs Bureau, Police Department and Environmental Protection Bureau should be fully prepared for the opening day by reviewing and improving the traffic control measures, back-up parking space plan, shuttle bus arrangement, and onsite order and security plan, and reevaluating the estimated traffic flow. The development mechanism of surrounding businesses should be similar to that of the Zuijhen Fossil Park. The Economic Development Bureau should thus work closely with the community and the District Office to create business opportunities for local residents by approving temporary stands and holding farmers&rsquo; markets, under the premise that the environment and traffic is not affected. There is still a week left before the museum opens, and I would like to ask the Cultural Affairs Bureau to report the concrete preparation work and complimentary measures on the meeting next week.",
