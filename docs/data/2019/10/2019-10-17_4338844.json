    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Recently, the food delivery workers&rsquo; safety and right to work has been a topic of great concern. Regarding the relationship between the food delivery companies and their drivers, it was confirmed yesterday by the Ministry of Labor that  employer-employee relationship does exist. As for the safety issue, it is common for the drivers to speed or break traffic rules in the attempt to reach the customer as soon as possible and within the deadline. The accidents involving delivery drivers in the past few days have drawn attention from the public to the issue of their working condition and treatment. Given that Tainan&rsquo;s accident rates this year are relatively high, the Police Department should further strengthen enforcement of traffic laws. The Labor Affairs Bureau should increase inspection on food delivery companies and drivers to ensure no labor laws are violated and no workers work overtime. The three basic principles should be applied: guidance within grace period, comprehensive inspection, and continuous follow-up.Announcement1.
