    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. Lateral communication between bureaus should be strengthened. When carrying out projects that require interdepartmental collaboration, such as the underground railway project, the relocation of Nanshan Public Cemetery, and the construction of the advanced transport system, communication channels should be built immediately to facilitate team work.2. Construction for the underground railway project is about to begin. Although the competent authority for the project is the Railway Bureau of the MOTC, the actual construction will take place in Tainan. The city government plans to expand the existing task force to include the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Department of Information. Regular meetings will be held to strengthen the communication between the central government and local residents.3. As the weather is turning warm, the rainy season is around the corner. I appreciate the Water Resources Bureau for initiating the flood prevention plan in advance. Given the increasing density of mosquitos, the Public Health Bureau should reinforce Dengue fever prevention, and the Environmental Protection Bureau should assist with disinfection. The Agriculture Bureau is expected to estimate the production and price of produce and take measures to prevent imbalance of supply and demand. I ask all departments to start preparing for the upcoming season.",
