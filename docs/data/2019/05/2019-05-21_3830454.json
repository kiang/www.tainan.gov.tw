Although there have been cases of dengue fever arriving from abroad within the last two weeks, thanks for the efforts from the Public Health Bureau, district and village offices, up to now there has not been domestic cases. Please continue to carry out preventive measures especially during the flood season. Residents should clean containers holding stagnant water, prevent mosquito bites, and go to nearby hospital for screening test as soon as possible when having fever.2. I want to thank our citizens for supporting the Tainan Cultural Park. Last week, tens of thousands of people flocked to the Tainan City Zuojhen Fossil Park, which was way beyond our expectation. In response to such large number of visitors, we have set up more parking spaces and increased the number of shuttle bus trips. In the future, when holding big-scale events, departments and bureaus should work together and coordinate resources to be fully prepared for the large crowds. The Department of Information and the Cultural Affairs Bureau, please enhance the promotion to attract more residents and tourists to come and visit the park.",
