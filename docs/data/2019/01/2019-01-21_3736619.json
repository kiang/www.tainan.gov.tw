    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. In response to the fatal child abuse case that occurred in Tainan yesterday (January 15), I solemnly stress that Tainan absolutely does not tolerate child abuse. Cases of child abuse will not be taken lightly. The solution to this problem is to identify high-risk families, increase home visits, and remain alert for possible cases of abuse. The Bureau of Social Affairs, Bureau of Education, and concerned departments are requested to establish a preventative safety network to prevent such regrettable tragedies from happening again.",
