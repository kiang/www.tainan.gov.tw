If African swine fever should breakout in neighboring counties\/cities, preventing it from spreading into Tainan will be immensely difficult. That being said, the municipal government must spare no effort in ensuring the safety of Tainan&rsquo;s citizens. I would like to ask the Agriculture Bureau and concerned departments to convene an interdepartmental meeting and take preventative measures centered on assisting animal husbandry businesses to prevent the disease in effective ways and to prevent African swine fever from entering Tainan.",
