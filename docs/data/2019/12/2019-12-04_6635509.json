All bureaus should stay vigilant as natural disasters are not something we can control. The flu season occurs in winter; concerned bureaus and departments should implement prevention strategies. Although the peak season for dengue fever and enterovirus has passed, we should continue to stay alert to prevent any new cases. The number of traffic accidents in Tainan City still remains high. It is our goal to effectively improve traffic safety and order. Concerned bureaus should assist with related policies implemented by the Bureau of Transportation and enforcement carried out by the Police Department. As we are approaching Chinese New Year, a series of celebration activities will unfold. Peak season of tourism will start from December to February next year. It is expected to see the number of tourists break new record. To achieve such goal, complimentary measures regarding traffic control, law and order, and environment should be in place in advance. Lastly, the Agriculture Bureau should start drafting the produce production and marketing plan for next year to prevent mismatch between demand and supply.Announcements1.
