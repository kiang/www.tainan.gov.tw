    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. On December 25, it will have been one year since we took office. I would like to extend my gratitude for all of you for your hard work and commitment. Together, we have delivered a lot for our citizens. Still, there is room for improvement. We should be open and listen to any suggestions from the public attentively, and respond to controversial topics with discretion.2. The cold air mass from the north already reached Taiwan. This year, the distribution of flu vaccines started at a much later date compared to previous years, which was related to the selection process and production of the vaccines by WHO. Central government procured vaccines collectively this year, with the goal of providing a more comprehensive protection to the elders and children. As a result, we see an increase of procurement expenses. Vaccines are now available. Concerned bureaus should increase promotion, and further protect the health of our citizens by achieving herd immunity.3. Central government&rsquo;s welfare policies, such as the 50-thousand subsidy given to new vehicle owners, concerned the rights of our citizens. Bureaus and departments should increase promotion, and work in line with those policies. Application deadline and procedure should be provided to the public in a timely manner. We do not want to leave a bad impression on our citizens and obstruct the good intentions of the central government because of some delays in administrative work.",
