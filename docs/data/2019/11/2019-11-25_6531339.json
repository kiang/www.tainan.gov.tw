    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. As we are approaching the end of the year, bureaus that have used the first and second reserve funds or have requested for advance payment from the central government should complete the subsidized projects as soon as possible to reach high execution rate. Low execution rate might cause doubt in the central government or city council, and affects the application of funds in the next year.2. As we are welcoming the year-end tourism peak season, a number of large-scale events will unfold. The Bureau of Transportation, Police Department, Environmental Protection Bureau, and the Fire Bureau should pay extra attention to maintain law and order, public safety, clean environment, and prevent fire to safeguard the safety of our citizens.",
