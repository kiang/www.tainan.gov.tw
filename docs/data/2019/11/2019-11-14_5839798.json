We are committed to improving Tainan&rsquo;s investment conditions, removing investment barriers, and enhancing public amenities around the city. Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed that the third phase construction of the Tainan Science Park is not merely an expansion of the industrial area; it should be more like developing a town and focus on enhancing public amenities in the neighborhood. Director General of the Bureau of Urban Development should follow the Premier&rsquo;s instruction and implement measures that are in line with the central government&rsquo;s policies.2. As we are approaching the second half of November and December, we are expecting numerous large-scale events and activities, which are expected to attract more tourists to Tainan. The Bureau of Transportation and the organizing bureaus or departments should make plans of traffic control and guidance and parking spaces in advance. The Police Department should help promote the relevant traffic policy and plans, and provide assistance on the day of the event. We don&rsquo;t want to see traffic issue becoming a by-product of thriving tourism industry. Also, the Shan Shang Garden And Old Waterworks Museum and the Zuijhen Fossil Park has seen a stable number of visitors. The Cultural Affairs Bureau should come up with plan for joint ticket as soon as possible as we hope to see the number continue to grow at a steady pace.Announcements1.
