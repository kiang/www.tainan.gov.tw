    "content": "Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks:1. As we are transitioning from autumn to winter, we need to watch out for big temperature swings between day and night. I urge all citizens to bring a jacket when leaving home to stay warm. In addition, free flu vaccines will be available in batches starting from November 15. The Public Health Bureau should announce such service and encourage people who are eligible to be vaccinated in order to stay healthy.2. Tainan city&rsquo;s accident rate has dropped significantly recently thanks to strict enforcement carried out by the Police Department. The Bureau of Transportation, Bureau of Civil Affairs, and the District Offices should continue raising people&rsquo;s awareness about traffic regulations to further reduce the number of accidents. As election season began, more police are needed in campaign rallies or other large-scale gatherings. I would like to thank them for their hard work in maintaining public order. However, we should not relax our guard in crime investigation, crime prevention, and maintenance of law and order. It is often said that &ldquo;police manpower is limited but civilian efforts have no end.&rdquo; We should join forces with community patrol teams, voluntary police, traffic auxiliary police, and volunteers to safeguard public security and safety.",
