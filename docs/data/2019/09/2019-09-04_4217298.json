Along with other relevant bureaus, the Bureau of Education should take the lead and carry out the promotion of traffic safety, disease and disaster prevention, and health and hygiene before the school starts. We hope that with the care and attention given from the society and their parents, all students could start the new semester safe and healthy.2. Tainan is a city that values sports. We hope to invite more international games to be held in Tainan, offering opportunities of exchange for local sports teams. Yesterday, we visited the Tainan Municipal Xinying Stadium with the Asian Football Confederation, and we learned that quite a few cities are bidding to host the next championship. I hope the Department of Sports could continue its efforts, and the Bureau of Education and Public Works Bureau could inspect and experience the venues in Tainan. Together, we should provide venues that meet international standards, and continue to fight for the right to host international games to let the world know Tainan.",
